# VPS Initial Setup Guide

A step-by-step guide for securing a new VPS with user management, SSH hardening, firewall configuration, and fail2ban setup.

## Prerequisites

- Fresh VPS with root access
- SSH client on your local machine

---

## 1. Initial System Update

Connect as root and update the system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

---

## 2. Create Non-Root User

Create a new user and grant sudo privileges:

```bash
adduser n8n-main
usermod -aG sudo n8n-main
```

---

## 3. Set Up SSH Key Authentication

Switch to the new user and configure SSH keys:

```bash
# Switch to new user
su - n8n-main

# Create SSH directory
mkdir ~/.ssh
cd ~/.ssh/

# Add your public key
sudo vim authorized_keys
# Paste your public SSH key, save and exit
```

---

## 4. Harden SSH Configuration

### Edit main SSH config

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Change the following settings:
- `PasswordAuthentication` from `yes` to `no`
- `PermitRootLogin` from `yes` to `no`
- `UsePAM` from `yes` to `no`

### Check for cloud-init override (some VPS providers)

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf
```

If this file exists, change:
- `PasswordAuthentication` from `yes` to `no`

### Reload SSH service

```bash
sudo systemctl reload ssh
```

---

## 5. Configure Firewall (UFW)

```bash
# Install UFW
sudo apt install ufw

# Set default policies
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow SSH
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH

# Review rules
sudo ufw show added

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

---

## 6. Enable Automatic Security Updates

```bash
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades
```

---

## 7. Set Up Fail2Ban

### Install dependencies (Debian 12)

```bash
sudo apt install python3-systemd -y
```

### Configure fail2ban

```bash
sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Add the following configuration:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
bantime = 1h
findtime = 10m
maxretry = 5

[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
backend = systemd
maxretry = 5
```

### Start and verify fail2ban

```bash
# Start fail2ban service
sudo systemctl start fail2ban

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status fail2ban

# Verify fail2ban is running
sudo fail2ban-client status

# Check SSH jail status
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

---

## âœ… Setup Complete

Your VPS is now secured with:
- Non-root user with sudo access
- SSH key authentication only
- Hardened SSH configuration
- Firewall protection (UFW)
- Automatic security updates
- Brute-force protection (fail2ban)

**Important:** Before closing your current SSH session, open a new terminal and verify you can connect with your new user and SSH key to avoid being locked out.
